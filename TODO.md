## Phase 4: Create Missing Backend APIs ✅
- [x] Create charges controller with full CRUD operations ✅
- [x] Create Charge and ChargeAssignment models ✅
- [x] Add charge routes to server.js ✅
- [x] Create database migration for charges tables ✅
- [x] Update API service to use real backend endpoints ✅

## Phase 5: Charges System Implementation Complete ✅
- [x] **Backend Models**: Created Charge and ChargeAssignment models with proper associations

- [ ] Implement real-time notifications with Socket.IO
- [ ] Add advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Implement email/SMS notifications for charges
- [ ] Add data export capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching

## Current Status: Phase 5 Complete ✅

### Latest Achievement: Complete Charges Management System
**What was implemented:**
1. **Backend Infrastructure**:
   - Charge model with fields: chargeName, type, amount, merchantId, isActive
   - ChargeAssignment model with fields: chargeId, customerId, amount, dueDate, status, merchantId
   - Proper Sequelize associations between models
   - Database migration with indexes for performance

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /charges` - Create new charge
   - `GET /charges` - Fetch all charges for merchant
   - `PUT /charges` - Update existing charge
   - `DELETE /charges/:id` - Delete charge (soft delete)
   - `POST /charges/assign` - Assign charge to customer
   - `GET /charges/history` - Get charge assignment history
   - `PUT /charges/assignments/status` - Update assignment status

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Updated API service to use real backend endpoints
   - Connected charges page to backend with proper error handling
   - Real-time data fetching and refresh after operations
   - Proper loading states and user feedback

**Next Steps**: The charges system is now fully functional and ready for production use. Future phases can focus on implementing similar systems for loans, investments, and other financial products.
